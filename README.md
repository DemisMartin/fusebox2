# FuseBox2
A new CoreXY 3D printer design

## Specifications
* Rigid 2020(top and sides)/2040(bottom) aluminum extrusion frame
* Non-crossing CoreXY belt path
* 210x200x220mm build area
* 390x340x412mm size
* PCB heatbed with 3 point leveling
* Centrifugal part cooling fan
* E3D V6 or Lite6 + Bowden extruder
* 24v + 32 bit electronics recommended

## Improvements over original FuseBox
* Slightly more compact
* Slightly larger build area
* Much greater frame and z axis rigidity
* Belt tensioning improvements - much easier to tension and screw-clamped to prevent slipping out
* Clamped bearing and rod mounts - no more structural zip ties
* Proper belt idlers - eliminates belt rubbing
* Extrusions (optionally) joined via tapped ends + screws instead of corner brackets
* Lowered part count
* Vertical gantry for easier hotend installation/removal and better cooling
* Better endstop mounting
